# My Solutions to Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a website featuring problems that beautifully combine **<span style="color:blue">math</span>** and **<span style="color:green">coding</span>**.  

Users have complete freedom to solve these problems using any methods they desire.  

The use of **<span style="color:red">computer programming</span>** and related skills is highly recommended.  

Here are some of the solutions I really enjoyed creating — my implementations for a variety of interesting problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net). 

**Happy Hunting!**
